Tree disease image classification
--

The core idea behind this project was to develop a comprehensive bot or application capable of classifying tree diseases. While this vision is still in progress, the challenge of collecting real-world data has paused its full implementation.

As a starting point, I utilized an apple tree disease image classification [dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nirmalsankalana/apple-tree-leaf-disease-dataset). This allowed me to implement and test image classification algorithmsâ€”both from scratch and using a pre-built model (b0 from EfficientNet). The aim was to assess the achievable performance with readily available data from Kaggle and the internet, providing insights for future development with authentic, field-collected data.
